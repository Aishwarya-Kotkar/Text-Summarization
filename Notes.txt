##Argument Parser :
argparse module used to link command line interface input to the program 

argparse.ArgumentParser : container for argument specifications.

 ArgumentParser.add_argument() method attaches individual argument specifications to the parser.

 ArgumentParser.parse_args() method runs the parser and places the extracted data. 
 It takes arguments passed to the script and convert into an object so it can easily accessed and used within script.
 
 
##Defaultdict from collection:
 A defaultdict is a subclass of the built-in Python dict class. It is defined in the collections module.
 The main difference between a defaultdict and a regular dict is that when a defaultdict is accessed with a key that does not exist,
 it automatically creates that key with a default value, rather than raising a KeyError.
 
 
##NLARGEST FROM HEAPQ:
	syntax: nlargest(n,iterable,key)
The nlargest function from the heapq library is used to find the n largest elements from an iterable,
where n is an integer specified as an argument. It returns a list of the n elements in descending order.
The function takes three arguments:

n: The number of elements to return.
iterable: The iterable to search for the largest elements in.
key: An optional key function that is used to determine what elements to compare. 
If not specified, the elements are compared directly.
